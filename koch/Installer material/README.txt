Koch Curve  - readme.txt

How To Run "klin":
     Run "klin" using requirements ("--req"), zenity interface ("-z"), or Gtkdialog interface ("-g").  If
no option is specified, we default to zenity mode of interface.  Below is the general command:

	   ./klin -options

Design Decisions & Project Issues:
     We have implemented our kgtk and kzen as follows: Both execute from klin, the default script
and decides which interface to implement depending on availability, the zenity mode which is installed
in most linux systems by default or Gtkdialog mode which is available in most environments of linux.
In the cpp files, we have prompted user to close first window display in output to start the second one.
It avoids taking input multiple times and gives continuity of output. The zoom() function in koch.cpp is
different from zooming functions in zoom.cpp. The difference is that zoom() in koch.cpp is zoom to center
which serves no purpose in 2D implementation of koch curve but is  merely an academic exercise. 
	The counter position is adjusted according to size entered by the user in koch.cpp. The implementation
of zoom functions in zoom.cpp distorts the screen reshape in koch.cpp. The library of necessary GL headers
is provided by the software. klin in linux takes care of setting path. We must give credit to my friends at
ask.fedoraproject.org who have helped me in writing interface of 
the program and suggesting DCP setup maker for RAD tools.
